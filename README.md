This is a static website hosted on S3 and distributed via CloudFront with secure OAC configuration and serverless architecture. 
It includes architecture diagram, policies, and deployment instructions.

The site was hosted without a custom domain, therefore there was no need to use AWS Route 53.

Challenges encountered: There was a delay during deployment, so i had to wait a little while so that cloudfront can get all the resources it needs from the S3 bucket.
